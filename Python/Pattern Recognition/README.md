These codes are the exercises and projects of the Introduction to Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning course, at Tampere University.

In codes that start with cifar10, have been used CIFAR10 dataset which is available from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html. Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images, Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.
