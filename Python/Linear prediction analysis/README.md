This code is one of the exercises in the Introduction to Audio Processing course, at Tampere University.
Code uses the o vowel sound, which is not included in this file.
The est_predictor_gain and reject_outliers functions were provided with the exercise instructions and are not made by me.

The code includes linear prediction analysis and formant analysis.
