These codes are the exercises and projects of the Introduction to Audio Processing course, at Tampere University.
The following sounds are used in the code: o.wav, brahms_hungarian_dance_5_short.wav, 
classic_rock_beat.wav, conga_groove.wav, latin_groove_short.wav. These are not included in this file.

The est_predictor_gain and reject_outliers functions in the linear_prediction were provided with the exercise instructions and are not made by me.
