This code is one of the exercises of the Introduction to Programming course, at Tampere University. I took the course in the autumn of 2019. This is one of my first codes.

The gameboard is a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares. One of the players is X and another is O. 
The first player who gets 3 of her/his marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner. The game ends, when all squares are full.
