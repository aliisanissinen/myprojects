This code is one of the exercises of the Programming 2: Basics course, at Tampere University. I took the course in the spring of 2020.

In the board class, the function print() was provided with the instructions. All other code is made by me.

This program generates a 15 puzzle. The board is the size of 4 x 4, and every round the 
player chooses a direction and a number tile, making the given tile to be moved 
to the given direction. Game will end when the numbers 1-15 (1-16) are in the ascending order, 
starting from top left and proceeding row by row. Empty space is represented by the 
number 16 in the code (constant EMPTY) and by dot when printing the game board.
