This code is one of the projects of the Programming 2: Basics course, at Tampere University. I took the course in the spring of 2020.

The program reads a file which containing the various shop chains, 
their stores, and their product selections. User can then search for different chains, 
different stores and see the store's product selections. User can also search for a place 
that sells the cheapest product.

Commands:
quit
chains
stores
selection <chain_name> <store_name>
cheapest <product_name>
products
