This code is one of the projects of the Programming 2: Basics course, at Tampere University. I took the course in the spring of 2020.

The Tetris game, where the player can move tetrominoes horizontally and down. 
Tetromino also moves down by themselves. The purpose of the game is to make full rows of 
rectangles. After that, the full lines disappear and the player gets points (15) and more 
available space in the game platform. The game ends when the column of tetrominoes grows 
to the top of the game platform.

The game starts with the start button and ends with the quit button. Player can pause the 
game with the pause button and continue with the continue button. Tetromino can be moved 
with the A and D keys on the keyboard or with the buttons on the screen (left and right). 
With the S key, you can move tetromino down. The game window shows the elapsed 
time and score.
