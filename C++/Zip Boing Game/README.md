This code is one of the exercises of the Programming 2: Basics course, at Tampere University. I took the course in the spring of 2020.

Program asks how many numbers the player would like to have. And then all the numbers are listed.
If the number is divisible by three, program prints "zip" and if it is divisible by seven, program prints
"boing". If the number is divisible by both of them, program prints "zip boing".
