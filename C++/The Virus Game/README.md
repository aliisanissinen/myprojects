This code is the project of the Programming 3: Techniques course, at Tampere University. 
I took the course in the autumn of 2020.

I did this project with Lari Lantonen, @lantonen. The Course part of the project was 
given to us with the instructions and the Game part and UnitTests are done by us.

The purpose of the game is to shoot randomly emerging viruses with the drone and get as 
many points as possible. Sometimes on the playing field appears vaccine, which allows killing 
all viruses with one shot. Killing one virus, gets you 5 points and if you use a vaccine 
it is 1 point per virus. You can move the drone with the WASD keys on the keyboard and shoot 
with the P key.

More information about the game and how we shared tasks with Lari can be found in the 
Documentation section, which is unfortunately in Finnish.
